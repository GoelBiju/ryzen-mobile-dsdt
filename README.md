# ryzen-mobile-dsdt

This repository hosts a collection of Differentiated System Description Tables (DSDTs) from various Ryzen Mobile Laptops.

## How do I use this?
Both DSL (uncompiled) and AML (compiled) DSDT files are uploaded for each laptop. Edits have been made by various users in order to
make their respective laptops perform better and these changes vary from laptop to laptop. Changes are noted in the README for each laptop folder.
