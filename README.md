# Ryzen Mobile DSDT

This repository is to host modification which I have attempted to make to the DSDT (ACPI Table) of the HP db0996na. 
Specifically, modifications involve the use of the DPTCi function defined in the AMD AGESA specification which allows for the modification of values set in the BIOS.

## What is the background for this?
